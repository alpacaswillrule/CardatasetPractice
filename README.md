# Car correlations

Got a webscraped dataset from https://www.salvageautosauction.com/cars-for-sale/quick-pick/vandalism,
Ran some regressions and did some plotting to look for correlations. 
Other approaches were computationally very expensive, so still looking for more ways to make sense of the data with my limited computing reasources.
